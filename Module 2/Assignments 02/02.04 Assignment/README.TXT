AUTHORS:Nina Nielsen

*************************************PMR****************************************
<+s> Although at first I had trouble using both print() and println(), I was able to figure out the proper way
     of using the two formats.
     
<-s> I had some problems with the concatenation since I kept on forgetting to input the + symbol in the program which 
     resulted in errors when finishing the expression.  
*********************************************************************************
What to improve on: To remind myself to type the + symbol between variables and operators. 
                    To get a better understanding of print() and println().
