PROJECT TITLE:01.05 HelloWorld
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:To get use to the programming format and to use print statement.
VERSION or DATE:16/06/18
AUTHORS: Nina Nielsen 

<+s>: The whole system was very simple and easy to use. It was not as difficult as I thought when implementing the codes into the system 
<-s>: Although I did not make any syntax errors, my final product appeared to have indentical sentences that I only put in once. 
      I am also struggling to distinguish the difference between print() and println().
